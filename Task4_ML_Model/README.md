# Task 4: Machine Learning Model

## Project: Spam Email Classification

This project is developed as part of the CODTECH Internship program.

It implements a Machine Learning model using Scikit-learn to classify emails as:
- Spam
- Ham (Not Spam)

## Files
- spam_classifier.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook containing ML model
- dataset.csv → Dataset used for training and testing

## Algorithm Used
Multinomial Naive Bayes

## Output
The model predicts email type and displays accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score.

This project fulfills the Machine Learning Model Implementation task of CODTECH.
