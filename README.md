## 🔹 Task 1 – Weather Data Fetching & Visualization
**Objective:**  
To fetch live weather data from a public API and display it using visualizations.

**Description:**  
A Python application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for multiple cities and display temperature, humidity, and conditions using charts.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Requests  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Streamlit  

**Output:**  
A dashboard that shows weather information and graphical comparisons for selected cities.

## 🔹 Task 2 – Data Analysis & PDF Report Generation
**Objective:**  
To read data from a file, analyze it, and generate a formatted PDF report.

**Description:**  
A Python script reads student marks from a CSV file, calculates:
- Average marks  
- Highest marks  
- Lowest marks  

Then it generates a professional PDF report using the ReportLab library.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- ReportLab  

**Output:**  
A PDF file named `Student_Report.pdf` containing formatted analysis results.

## 🔹 Task 3 – Data Visualization using Python
**Objective:**  
To visualize data using Python libraries.

**Description:**  
This task involves reading structured data and creating graphical representations such as bar charts and line graphs to understand trends and comparisons.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

**Output:**  
Graphical plots showing meaningful insights from the dataset.

## 🔹 Task 4 – Machine Learning Model Implementation
**Objective:**  
To build a predictive model using Scikit-learn.

**Project:** Spam Email Classification

**Description:**  
A machine learning model was developed to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

**Files:**  
- `spam_classifier.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with model implementation  
- `dataset.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing  

**Output:**  
The model predicts email categories and displays:
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score
